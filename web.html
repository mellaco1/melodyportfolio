          My passion for Web Design started at the beginning of the 2018 school year, when I participated in a UCONN/ECE class for Digital Media.
          I quickly learned how to code a website, which became the portfolio in which you are currently viewing. </p>
          <p> Additional to the website itself, I also designed the logo on the top left of the screen.
            I have always had an eye for designing things-- when I was little I was convinced I was going to be an interior designer because I was constantly
            rearranging my bedroom and imagining new ways to make it come to life. </p>
            <p>I feel it's the same idea with Web Design. I get to choose what is displayed and in what fashion, and believe that my voice finds a way to be known within it.</p>
            <p>Aside from my work with Web Design in school, I have also gotten the opportunity to use my growing knowledge in my job. I work at Artisans Marketplace, a small art
              shop located in Plainville, CT. The owner has been working towards the launch of her new cms website, and turned to me to help her work on it. I took her instructions,
              which were to fill in the different artists and create captivating descriptions for each. Then, I helped choose the appropriate photo to represent each artist. And if
              there wasn’t a perfect one, I went out and captured one.</p>
            <p>There were a few instances where she couldn’t figure out how to do certain tasks. I had never taken a class strictly focused on the creation of a cms website, but I was
              determined to figure out how to do these things. I have the ability to look at the current state of a website, and instinctively find a way to cure it. The answer is usually
              just a few clicks away, but some people don’t have the technological background to be able to do that. </p>
