        <p>
          I have been writing for as long as I can remember. I began to write fiction in fourth grade. I'd be asked to write a daily entry in my language arts notebook, and from the first entry, I enjoyed it. From then on I was one of the only kids in class who genuinely liked to write, but I didn't mind.
          I liked the idea of creating my own world for my own characters, something that only fiction could provide. With the help of my various language arts teachers, my writing, and love for writing, evolved. I have written so many unfinished novels and stories that I could probably fill up multiple notebooks.
          When other kids were outside playing sports, I was writing something. When I was bored, I'd take out one of my various notebooks and write. When I discovered Google Drive, all of my work was transported. It was much easier to get my ideas elsewhere on an electronic than on paper. In 2015, I began my first
          real project, The Keys to Phobia. Given my track record, I didn't anticipate success or to be finished. But somehow, I pulled through and was able to write out, over the course of three years, a full fledged novel. Now I'm starting the sequel!
        </p>
        <p>
          As already stated, I am naturally drawn to fiction. But because I attend a school of the arts, I have been able to explore poetry and the personal essay as well. None of my pieces are finished. I believe that there is never going to be a "final draft." There only comes a point when the author is comfortable
          sharing his or her heart with the world. I consider that to be finished.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <h4> Alternate Names For Me
          <p>
            1. Mel, the first nickname that really stuck. An easier and quicker way to address me, and the most common one too. I used to only be called Mel by family, but as the years progressed, the new people I met also found it easiest to call me Mel. Fast forward a few years, and suddenly acquaintances thought it
            was okay to call me Mel. It wasn’t a bad thing, but left an unknowing mood that still has yet to leave me. I don’t know if I want people I don’t know to call me Mel, and am unsure if I ever will.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. Mel Mel, the first variant of the first nickname. It was originated by my parents when I was little, but then was reintroduced a few years back, by one of my best friends. Mel hasn’t made a comeback in quite some time.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Ms Mel, one of my favorites. It began as “Ms Melody” when I first started to film my movie, TKTP. It changed to “Ms Mel” when my cast switched and I became closer to everyone. The name has become distant ever since the movie premiered, but the occasional throw in of the name always makes me smile. I was
            called Ms Mel to create a formal yet informal bond. Members of the cast would usually say “Yes Ms Mel,” and I’d respond with a laugh, but the relationship between us was so tight and so important, and that nickname gave us something original to stand by.
          </p>
          <p>
            4. Meleody. Throwback to the first snow delay of Freshman year. Being the conscientious student I still am, I emailed my teacher about what I missed in class. Clearly by accident, the teacher addressed me as “Meleody” and the moment I read it, I couldn’t stop myself from laughing. Now, I’m called Meleody as
            a joke, and, if nothing else, just that name can break silence.
          </p>
          <p>
            5. Melly, one of my favorite nicknames. Last year, one of my best friends called me Melly and I was at first confused. But it stuck, and I grew attached to it. Down the hall, I’d hear “Melly!” and I instantly knew who was calling me. I miss being called Melly. The name feels distant, but I don’t want it to.
            Today, every time I hear this name I am reminded of this friendship that is so important to me. The many, many times that I have heard my friend address me this way have made me so happy.
          </p>
            <p>
            6. Meldy, the cutest. My baby cousin Autumn Hope has dubbed me Meldy, because she’s too young to know otherwise. I don’t think I’ll ever correct her. Autumn and I have a bond that cannot and will not ever be broken. She’s the first person I can truly say I’ve known since birth, and remember. From the day
            after she was born until today, I am amazed and in awe at how cute and smart she is. Meldy is a name that will never, ever end.
          </p>
          <p>
            Melody is just my birth name. I am only called Melody by my teachers and my parents if I am in trouble, or by others that just haven’t caught on to the commonality that is Mel. Because I have had so many people call me so many different names, on occasion I’ll even forget that Melody is my name.

          <h4> My Grandma's Kitchen
            <p>
            Love built Grandma’s kitchen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Grandpa used to watch her bake.
          </p>
          <p>
            The smell of spaghetti on Sundays would
          </p>
          <p>
            Always reach each corner of the house, and 20 mouths would
          </p>
          <p>
            Instantly devour it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Love made Grandma’s kitchen
          </p>
          <p>
            A place to gather.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each Sunday when branches of the family tree join for dinner,
          </p>
          <p>
            Everyone goes to the kitchen first.
          </p>
          <p>
            Grandma receives enough kisses and hugs to last her whole life and
          </p>
          <p>
            When the food is prepared, it’s time to eat.
          </p>
          <p>
            Love created the memories in Grandma’s kitchen,
          </p>
          <p>
            With the door leading to the rest of the world being a part of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each time someone walks through the door, gleaming faces
          </p>
          <p>
            Welcome them.
          </p>
          <p>
            There’s a pattern, the first to arrive stands in the kitchen,
          </p>
          <p>
            And when another shows up, that person will
          </p>
          <p>
            Always join them.
          </p>
          <p>
            When family members have missed dinner for some time,
          </p>
          <p>
            Seeing them walk through the door creates a memory in itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Especially if that person is a two-year-old who changes daily.
          </p>
          <p>
            Love is what brought the people in Grandma’s kitchen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Love is what started it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Love is what keeps it going.
          </p>
