                        <p> Through high school and college, and also on my own, I have made a countless amount of videos. But I have a particular few
                          that I feel best represent who I am and what my artistic style is. </p>
                          <p> I used to gravitate towards fiction, but as I have grown and learned more have explored other mediums,
                            such as documentary and TV. Now, my primary interest is working with documentaries. I love telling people's
                          stories in the form of a video. My main passion is the video editing aspect, but I also love devising the interview
                        questions and being present for the person's responses. </p>

                    proud of how it turned out.</p>

                        <p>During the Corona pandemic, I wanted to do something that would put my creative energy to use.
                        My sister and I decided to make a fun competition series, called "Competition: Corona." Using our phones,
                        we filmed each episode, and then I took a day to edit and post them. We know how hard this time is for
                        everyone, and are doing this to entertain ourselves, and others. Smiles and laughs are the goal!</p>
                        <p> Our two favorite episodes are the ones listed here, Episodes 3 and 7. Enjoy! </p>

                      GHAA Class of 2020 Senior Video
                      </h3>
                      <p>In my senior year of high school, I decided to create a video that would act as a keepsake for my peers. It turned into much larger of
                      a project than I had originally intended it to when COVID-19 became a global issue, and cancelled schools. I had just filmed the staff and teacher interviews
                    and intended to film the student interviews the next week. I struggled to cope with the reality that faced me, but ultimately decided to continue to work on this project. </p>
                    <p>I reached out to as many of my peers as possible and received many submissions. I spent a full day editing this project together after finding out about the
                    "too close for comfort" deadline. I'm proud of this final product, and am so thrilled that I stuck with it. It made me realize how much I like filming and editing
                    these types of projects. Non-fiction. Real. Raw. Collaborative. Meaningful.</p>

                                <p>One of my large projects of senior year stemmed from a class where we were tasked with creating an original TV pilot.
                                While teaching the underclassmen what those before me taught me, I directed the episode, and took the time to edit it, too.
