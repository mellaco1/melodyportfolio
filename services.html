                        <p> Through GHAA and also on my own, I have made a countless amount of videos. But I have a particular few

                          <p> I used to gravitate towards fiction, but as I have grown and learned more have explored other mediums,
                            such as Documentary and TV. </p>

            GHAA Class of 2020 Senior Video
            </h3>
            <p> In my senior year of high school, I decided to create a video that would act as a keepsake for my peers. It turned into much larger of
            a project than I had originally intended it to when COVID-19 became a global issue, and cancelled schools. I had just filmed the staff and teacher interviews
          and intended to film the student interviews the next week. I struggled to cope with the reality that faced me, but ultimately decided to continue to work on this project. </p>
          <p>I reached out to as many of my peers as possible and received many submissions. I spent a full day editing this project together after finding out about the
      "too close for comfort" deadline. I'm proud of this final product, and am so thrilled that I stuck with it. It made me realize how much I like filming and editing
    these types of projects. Non-fiction. Real. Raw. Collaborative. Meaningful.</p>

          <p>During the Corona pandemic, I wanted to do something that would put my creative energy to use.
          My sister and I decided to make a fun competition series, called "Competition: Corona." Using our phones,
          we have filmed each episode, and then I take a day to edit and post them. We know how hard this time is for
          everyone, and are doing this to entertain ourselves, and others. Smiles and laughs are the goal!</p>
          <p> Our two favorite episodes are the ones listed here, Episodes 3 and 7. Enjoy! </p>
