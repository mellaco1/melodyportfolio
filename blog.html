                                        Babysitting

                                  I have been babysitting since I was 13. I have always had a strong connection with kids; I would be the person
                                who you would find near the kid's table or who was watching over the little ones at a family event. As soon as
                              I was of age, I reached out to members of my church and offered up my services. Then, a few years later, I joined
                            care.com, a babysitting website where families can locate and reach out to local caregivers. It took some effort to start
                            off, but after some time, I had found my first family.
                          </p>
<p>
  Today, I have cared for around 14 families, with their children's ages ranging from newborn to middle school. It is truly one of my passions and I
  enjoy all the time I get to spend with these kids.

                                          </h4>
                              <p> My passion for Web Design started at the beginning of the 2018 school year, when I participated in a UCONN/ECE class for Digital Media.
                            I quickly learned how to code a website, which became the portfolio in which you are currently viewing. </p>
                            <p> Additional to the website itself, I also designed the logo on the top left of the screen.
                              I have always had an eye for designing things-- when I was little I was convinced I was going to be an interior designer because I was constantly
                              rearranging my bedroom and imagining new ways to make it come to life. </p>
                              <p>I feel it's the same idea with Web Design. I get to choose what is displayed and in what fashion, and believe that my voice finds a way to be known within it.</p>
                              <p>Aside from my work with Web Design in school, I have also gotten the opportunity to use my growing knowledge in my job. I work at Artisans Marketplace, a small art
                                shop located in Plainville, CT. The owner has been working towards the launch of her new cms website, and turned to me to help her work on it. I took her instructions,
                                which were to fill in the different artists and create captivating descriptions for each. Then, I helped choose the appropriate photo to represent each artist. And if
                                there wasn’t a perfect one, I went out and captured one.</p>
                              <p>There were a few instances where she couldn’t figure out how to do certain tasks. I had never taken a class strictly focused on the creation of a cms website, but I was
                                determined to figure out how to do these things. I love being taught how to do new things, but also to teach myself (and others), learning along the way. </p>
